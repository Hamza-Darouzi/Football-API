# FootballAPI

FootballAPI is a robust and efficient web API built using ASP.NET Core Web API 7. It leverages the power of Entity Framework Core 7 as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. The project is designed using the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and making the codebase maintainable and scalable.

## Features

- **ASP.NET Core Web API 7**: A framework for building HTTP services with ASP.NET Core.
- **Entity Framework Core 7 (EF Core 7)**: A lightweight, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.
- **Clean Architecture**: An architectural approach that separates the software into concentric layers with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns. This results in a loosely coupled and easily testable application.
- **Repository Pattern**: A design pattern that mediates data from and to the domain and data mapping layers (like Entity Framework).
- **Unit of Work**: A design pattern that maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes.
- **AutoMapper**: A simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another.

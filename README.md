# FootballAPI

FootballAPI is a robust and efficient web API built using ASP.NET Core 8. It leverages the power of Entity Framework Core 8 as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. The project is designed using the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and making the codebase maintainable and scalable.

## Features

- **ASP.NET Core 8**: A framework for building HTTP services with the latest features and improvements.
- **Entity Framework Core 8 (EF Core 8)**: A lightweight, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: An architectural approach that focuses on modeling the domain and its logic, promoting a clear structure and understanding of business requirements.
- **Clean Architecture**: An architectural approach that separates the software into concentric layers with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns, resulting in a loosely coupled and easily testable application.
- **Repository Pattern**: A design pattern that mediates data from and to the domain and data mapping layers (like Entity Framework).
- **Unit of Work**: A design pattern that maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes.
- **AutoMapper**: A simple library built to map one object to another, reducing the need for boilerplate code.
- **JWT Authentication**: A secure method for authenticating users in your API.
- **Minimal API**: An additional project within the solution that showcases the use of Minimal APIs for building lightweight HTTP services.
- **Pagination**: Implemented to facilitate easier data browsing, allowing users to navigate through large datasets efficiently.
